      <section>
        <h3>Step 1: Height and Width</h3>
        <p>Make sure all of your sprue pieces are cut to the intended height of your fence, with any outward branches cleaned off.</p>

        <p>I wanted this for 40k, so I just got one of my 40k Chaos Marines and stood it up. I based the height of my fence posts on what looked good next to that. I choose to go for 4cm high posts. I also chose to use 4 posts, but you can use more if you like. 
        The ratio of the height of the posts to the width between two posts along the fence should be about 4:5. That means that a 4cm high fence should have a distance of about 5cm between each post. Simples!</p> 
        
        <p>With 4 posts that gave me a fence just over 15cm wide (5cm wide gaps X 3gaps), going slightly over since there is one more post than there is gaps, you need to add the width of the last post to the overall width. 
        I measured out my wire mesh, and used a sharp scalpel to cut it out. Place the mesh firmly on your cutting mat, and use the cutting mat measurements to ensure accuracy.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Drilling</h3>
        <p>You could just glue the posts to the mesh, but that would be too easy. Plus, the low coverage on the mesh will mean it will look bad(you will see residual glue, which destroys the illusion), and probably won't stick for long.</p>

        <p>If you pin, on the other hand, the mesh is less likely to come off, but the kind of pinning I'm going to be doing can be time consuming. Get your smallest drill bit that will still allow your thinnest wire to fit in the hole made. I used a 0.8mm drill bit. Then you're going to get your pin vice again and drill two small holes side by side at intervals going up each post. It is best to keep it the same height on every post, but otherwise it's really your choice how many of these you include.</p>

        <p>Clip short lengths of thin wire, and bend them so that the two ends are facing the same way. I needed a pliers to do this properly. </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Step 3: Fitting</h3>
        <p>Put this piece of bent wire into the two holes. If the piece of wire is too long on either side, clip it and try again. Once it fits well, layer the wire mesh over the sprue poles like you did before, and make sure it is as accurate to your earlier fit test as before.</p>

        <p>Glue the bent wire and insert the bent piece of wire into the two holes through the wire mesh. You might need to cut a small hole in the wire mesh to get the piece of wire through, but be careful you don't rip the wire mesh completely, as the whole point is to have something which holds the wire mesh to the sprue bits. Repeat until you have attached every point on each of your poles to your mesh, making sure that the poles are parallel to each other and that you have spaced them correctly. If there is any overlap of mesh around the end poles, or at the top or bottom of the fence, now is the time to deal with it. Clip it off with clippers, or a scissors you don't mind getting blunt.</p>

          <h3>Caution!</h3>
      	  <p> If you want to have a bend in the fence, you must think carefully about how it will be done. When making a bend you must make sure that you keep the posts on the inner angle of the bend, with the fence warping around the posts. It looks weird the other way, and it is more likely to fall apart.</p>
