        <p class="tutorial_opener">Once you get into crunchier wargames, you'll often find that you need to use various tokens to denote points of special interest on the battlefield, special effects on units, and even battle damage. This tutorial shows you how to make magnetic tokens that are easier to manage.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: The token sheet</h3>
        <p>First of all, you'll need a printable sheet of various numbers and symbols that will represent the tokens you need. I have <a href="http://imgur.com/i5bxXi2">included one here</a>, but you can easily make your own. Perhaps do a test print of a couple of numbers or symbols from the sheet, checking that the font size and printer settings give you the result you want. Then print the sheet.</p>
      </section>

      
      <section>
        <h3>Step 2: Magnetic sheet</h3>
        <p>Be careful when gluing your token sheet to your magnetic sheet. You don't want the token sheet to get too much damp glue, as this will cause it to fall apart quite quickly. If the magnetic sheet has a peel away back, use that instead of glue, but be careful of your token sheet placement.</p>

          <h3>Caution!</h3>
      	  <p>For multipart models you should plan out where each driled hole will go, so that you don't have overlapping holes from different pieces going into the main body of a mini at the same place.</p>
        </div>
      </aside>

      <section>
        <h3>Step 3:Creating individual tokens</h3>
        <p>Ensure your magnetised token sheet is completely dry before taking this step. Use your bases to mark above and below each token number. The width of each base should be able to fit two tokens.</p>


        <p>Cut out a couple of sample tokens before proceeding with the rest of the sheet. Test these on a base to see if they fit the height and width of the base accurately.</p>

        <p>Once you have these sample tokens that fit the base accurately, use them to mark and cut out the remaining tokens, paying particular attention to the width as you go.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Step 4: Steel token holders</h3>
        <p>Using the large pliers I cut out small steel squares that fit the 28mm bases. I used universal glue to stick these two pieces together tightly.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Step 5:Storage and use</h3>
        <p>Once all pieces have dried, you will have everything you need to create all the tokens you need. If you can find a small metal tin(similar to the fisherman's friend mints box), this acts best for storage, as the magnetic tokens will remain in place during transport. Please each pile of numbers into the metal tin in separate piles, and fill the remaining space with the steel bases.</p>
      </section> 

      <section>
        <p>Whenever you have a new damage number you have to take the two numbers you want, out of the tin, and put them on a base. When damage changes again you simple take them off and replace them with the new set of numbers. This is surprisingly quick, but more importantly it prevents the damage track being mixed up if it is knocked over or moved for any reason. In addition, if your miniatures are on magnetic bases, you may be able to put these tokens directly on the base and store them there while you move the base around.</p> 

        <p>I hope this was helpful. If people have any other suggestions I should add in please let me know.</p>
