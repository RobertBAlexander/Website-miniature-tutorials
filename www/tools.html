        <p>Glue is a substance applied to one surface, or both surfaces, of two separate items that binds them together and resists their separation. There are a lot of different kinds of glue, and some are used more often than others in miniatures building. You will often find yourself using Super Glue and Poly Cement, but PVA glue, wood glue and universal glue also useful, depending on what materials you are gluing.</p>

        <p>There are many many ways to measure things, depending on what your need is at the time. A meaasuring tape is usually needed for measuring larger or awkward objects</p>

        </span></span></div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>A scalpel is usually used for when you need clean, sharp cuts into materials. It is not appropriate for cutting metal, even metal wires. However it is great for plastics, card and other softer materials.</p>

        </span></span></div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>These hardy pliers are great for clipping pieces off a material much faster than a scalpel. They do not cut as cleanly as a scalpel, but they are necessary for cutting things such as metal wires, or other hard objects. You would need something stronger to cut steel sheets though.</p>

      <section>
        <p>A pin vice drill is essential for miniature builders who want to build complex multipart models. Even a simple model that has a small connection surface area, like a weapon or leg joint is best pinned, if any part is metal or resin. A pin vice drill is, in my opinion, one of the few essential tools that you will have to buy for exclusive use with your miniatures.</p>

      <section>
        <p>Basing sand is not necessarily essential, but it is a very popular way of creating interesting bases for miniatures. Quite often people will use this sand on their bases, or their terrain. The reality is that this is just normal sand I took from building work in my garden. You don't have to spend much to get this, but be careful that you are picking up clean, filtered sand only!</p>

      <section>
        <p>Magnetic sheets, or magnets were something I didn't use for many many years in my hobby. However I eventually decided to try them out for holding individual models in place on their warhammer bases. This went ok, but it inspired me to try more magnet options. Now I'm at the point where and time i make a base, I plan it so that I can magnetise it in the future if I want.</p>

        </span></span></div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>Steel is a very tough material to work with. Do not use pliers that are for cutting wire, or other smaller and softer materials on your steel sheets. These will need much more powerful pliers, like those you would use in home DIY work. A scalpel or scissors will be completely ruined by these. However there is no denying that these are great for sticking anything magnetised firmly in place, which still being detachable.</p>

        <p>Paper, or paprus. If you don't know what this is, or how it would be used... I'm not sure I can help. Paper can be great for printing out more detailed work that you could never paint by hand, and using it for tokens or banners.</p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <p>A hobbyist will always have leftover sprue after building a model, or piece of terrain. Some of the most common forms of sprue are akin to those in gamesworkshop kits. These tend to be long rectangular sticks, which can be cut up and used for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tYEM_oGnU0">surprising variety of things</a> in the hobby world.</p>

        <p>Wire for pinning can come in many many forms. I have used a variety of wires from various projects. For beginner hobbyists, probably the most easy to find wire is paper clips. Paper clips are the right width, and, more importantly, the right toughness(while still having maleability) for them to be used for pinning models, and for a variety of other things in your hobby projects.</p>

      <section>
        <p>Wire mesh, or chicken wire is a great investment, especially for hobbyists who are into present or future wargaming. They can be used for base decorations, and terrain building. You do need to make sure you get wire that has a small thread, you don't want to end up with a 28mm fence that looks like a human could crawl through the gaps in the wires.</p>
